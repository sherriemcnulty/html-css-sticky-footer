      <p id="intro-txt">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form
        of
        a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is
        available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which allows
        designers
        to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a first-century BC text by the
        Roman
        statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized
        by
        advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s
        when
        Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other
        popular word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since adopted Lorem ipsum as well.
        The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et
        malorum.[1][2]
        The physical source may have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus, where the Latin text,
        presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with "Neque porro quisquam est qui do-" and
        continues
        on page 36 with "lorem ipsum ...", suggesting that the galley type of that page was mixed up to make the dummy
        text
        seen today.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar at Hampden–Sydney
        College.
        McClintock connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime before 1982 while searching for instances of the
        Latin
        word consectetur, which was rarely used in classical literature.[4] McClintock first published his discovery in
        a
        1994 letter to the editor of Before & After magazine, contesting the editor's earlier claim that Lorem ipsum had
        no
        meaning.[5]

        The relevant section of Cicero as printed in the source is reproduced below with fragments used in Lorem ipsum
        underlined. Letters in brackets were added to Lorem ipsum and were not present in the source text:
